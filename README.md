This is an app to plan out trips and travels on a map, as well as an itinerary in a calendar to correlate with the map.

Travelary is an app that helps users plan out their travels and store their itineraries. 
For every trip a user adds, they can add several attractions (restaurants, museums, parks, etc) 
that are rendered in a map or calendar view. 
Each attraction is then rated by the user for future reference.
There is also a social aspect to the app, 
where you can share your trip with friends by inviting them to be admins and contribute to the trip, 
or just follow it without making changes.  
Users can also upload photos to their trip or to specific attractions, in order to share with friends (trip admins and followers).
If a user wants to create a trip, but doesn't know exactly where to go, they can get ideas by exploring public trips from other users,
through the explore feature.
